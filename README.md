## Review

It is corny to say but I am facinated by how AI has become one of the most talked topic in software development in recent years. One thing I found interesting about this article is that it explains how AI won't replaced humans (as many claimed) but will become a tool that change the way we work. It mentions how the way of thinking will shift from "design" to "platform" with AI at the core of platform and SaaS development. Moreover, it states that AI enables the business to "bring ideas to reality very rapidly" which I am specifically excited about. I am curious about how AI will shape the future of software development as it continuouslt to grow.
